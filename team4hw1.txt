  We followed the instructions and saw that we have to first draw a line and rotate by 90 degrees. Repeating this process gives us a square.

  We already knew how to draw a square, so in order to draw a triangle, we had to turn 150 degrees in total since we already had a line at the bottom.
We first rotated 30 degrees and drew 100 units of line, and then rotated the turtle 120 degrees and drew 100 units of line again. This gave us a perfect roof.

  We learned how to make loops.

  We found out that we have to draw a line and rotate 72 degrees and repeat this process 5 times.
How we found out that it's 72 degrees is a pentagon's inner angle is 108 degrees, So we subtracted 108 from 180 and we found 72.

sides = 7 // or 5, 6, whatever you want.
for [1..sides]
  rt 360/sides
  fd 100

  We knew how to make loops, so in order to get what shape the user wants, we had to assign a variable and use that variable several times in the process.
Dividing 360 by number of sides gives of how much degrees we have to rotate. Using that we completed our program.
